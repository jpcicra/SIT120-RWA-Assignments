Involves the actual buttons, text, and pixels that appear on the screen.
The GUI designer would be responsible for everything about how a web site or
application appears in the interface . 
This includes visuals as well as overall architecture of the page. 
Example: When should we put the Sign Up button? 
UX 
This is a much broader and higher-level discipline than GUI, because it includes not just 
the interface, but also all the systems and interactions that support it. 
Example: The UX designer should care about what happens when a frustrated user calls 
the help desk as well as how pixels appear on the screen.
